# VonBuddies - Fun small parody of FNAF but with the new King Von anti privacy screen!

# NOTE!!! THIS WAS NOT MADE FOR MOBILE DEVICES!!! Please access this on a PC or LAPTOP!!

## JFG (Just For Gags)

## Honestly, I thought it would be funny to see how it would actually look as an anti-privacy screen. The idea hit me when I was randomly in bed, scrolling on Instagram and saw the anti-privacy screen so I made this just for laughs and gags lol. Maybe I'll expand this out to a fully fledged game in the future.
